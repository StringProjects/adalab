# Chat We. with String Projects

This project has been developed for String as a final project of Adalab.

This project is based on the development of a kind of social network focused on messaging. It is intended to facilitate the communication among members of the same channel or private group. This social network will allow us to log in as users, access these groups and be able to send messages within them creating a thread.

# Project structure

The project has been created with React, therefore, its structure is based on components.

### Content and Characteristics

- Login and logout
- Group listing page
- Group conversation page
- Thread page

## Instalation

In order to install the project, you must type `npm install` into the terminal to install the node modules packages.

## Start Project

To start the project, type `npm start`.

### Used technologies 

This app has been built using `bootstrap`,`react`,`javascript`,`jsx` and `sass`.

## Tools

This project has been created with Create React App (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app),
a generating tool that automates the installation of React and Babel, which will transform the ES6 code into ES5 and preconfigure the project.

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks. You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make any changes.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

It launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

It builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly sets React into production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

It is not mandatory to use the `eject` command. This curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use it. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it whenever you need it.

While we recommend using experimental proposals with some caution, Facebook heavily uses these features in the product code, so we intend to provide [codemods](https://medium.com/@cpojer/effective-javascript-codemods-5a6686bb46fb) if any of these proposals change in the future.## Supported Browsers

By default, the generated project uses the latest version of React.

You can refer [to the React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#browser-support) for more information about supported browsers.
